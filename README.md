# OpenGL-Project
<div>
  <h3><b>Language used: Python while importing OpenGL libraries.</b></h3>
  
  <p><b>Project Scenario:</b>
 
The project is basically on a missile traveling in space. The missile can either hit the Earth or can move over it. If it hits the Earth, the Earth will get destroyed otherwise it will be saved. To change the directory of the missile towards the Earth, scaling, translation and rotation is being used.<br>

<b>Project Requirements:</b><br>

User input: For this part of the project, we took some inputs from the user like ‘start’, ‘next’, ‘phase3’, ‘hit’, ‘cracked’, ‘destroyed’ and ‘saved’, to change the current scenario.<br>

<b>Algorithms used:</b><br> 

1.	Midpoint Line Algorithm- This algorithm was used to draw all the lines in our project. Such as the solid body of the missile, the green land on the Earth and as well as the texts ‘END’ and ‘SAVED’.<br>

2.	Midpoint Circle Algorithm- This algorithm was used to draw the shape of the Earth, the Destroyed Earth(the fragments after destruction) and the asteroids.<br>
